# CPSC582-final-project
# Instructions to run code:
- The LGG and Br35H datasets must be in a folder called "data" in the same directory as the code. The directory structure expected is "data/LGG_preprocessed/tumor" or "data/LGG_preprocessed/normal" and the same for Br35H.

- The model can be trained by running "domain_adaption.py"
